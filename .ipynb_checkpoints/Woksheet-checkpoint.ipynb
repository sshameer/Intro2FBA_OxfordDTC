    "\n",
    "In Constraint-based modelling,  \n",
    "(a) stoichiometry of metabolites involved in reaction that make up the biological system, and  \n",
    "(b) upper and lower limits (or constraints) on metabolic fluxes if known  \n",
    "are used to generate a set of linear equations that when solved reveal a solution space for all feasible flux distributions in the biological system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "FBA is the most popular approach in CBM. In FBA, in addition to the above requirements, an expression representing the biological objective of the system is defined. Unicellular organism typically aim to simply grow and multiply. When modelling these systems, a biomass composition is experimentally determined and the information is used to add a reaction that drains metabolites and macromolecules in the same proportion from the system. This reaction is called the \"Biomass\" reaction. Any flux through the biomass reaction represents the growth by cell division. Specialized tissue in multicellular organisms on the other hand may have completely different purpose. For example, the purpose of mesophyl cells that make up most of the leaves in plants is to generate sugar and amino acids for the plant using energy from the sun. The aim of cortical cells of mature roots on the other hand would be to uptake nutrients from the soil and load into the xylem to distributed to the rest of the plant. In these cases, an equation representing the specific objective need to be defined.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once an appropriate objective function is determined, linear programming is used to identify a point in the solution space with optimal value for the objective expression.\n",

    "Escher-FBA is an interactive pathway visualization tool for on-the-fly flux balance analysis (FBA) calculations ([Rowe, Palsson & King, 2018](https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0607-5))\n",

    "    - Note that the model has a default flux distribution. The default glucose uptake (EX_glc_e) in this model is -10 (negative flux here suggests uptake of glucose)  \n",
    "2) Find out if there are any constraints on O2 uptake (EX_o2_e) in the model and determine the O2 influx in the default flux distribution\n",
    "    - Quick way to track down a reaction on Escher-FBA is to use \"Ctrl+F\" and then type in the ID of the reaction you are looking for. In this case EX_o2_e.\n",
    "    - Mouse over the reaction ID and note down the upper and lower bound. The default upper and lower bounds on the flux is 1000 and -1000 respectively. In most models this means there are no limits (or constraints) imposed on the flux.\n",
    "    - Mousing over the reaction ID can also reveal the current flux through the reaction.\n",
    "    - Note down the influxes and outfluxes of the model in aerobic conditions (all reactions starting with \"EX_\").\n",
    "3) What happens if the model does not have access to O2 in its environment? (as anaerobic scenario)\n",
    "    - Mouse over the EX_o2_e reaction and use the sliders or value-entry-box to set the lower bound of the reaction to 0\n",
    "    - Note the change in flux. \n",
