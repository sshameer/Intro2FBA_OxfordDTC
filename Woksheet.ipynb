    "FBA is the most popular approach in CBM. In FBA, in addition to the above requirements, an expression representing the biological objective of the system is defined. Unicellular organism typically aim to simply grow and multiply. When modelling these systems, a biomass composition is experimentally determined and the information is used to add a reaction that drains metabolites and macromolecules in the same proportion from the system. This reaction is called the \"Biomass\" reaction. Any flux through the biomass reaction represents the growth by cell division. Specialized tissue in multicellular organisms on the other hand may have completely different purpose. For example, the purpose of mesophyl cells that make up most of the leaves in plants is to generate sugar and amino acids for the plant using energy from the sun. The aim of cortical cells of mature roots on the other hand would be to uptake nutrients from the soil and load into the xylem to distributed to the rest of the plant. In these cases, an equation representing the specific objective need to be defined.\n",

It is naturally found in mammal intestines but due to its short replication time and the amount of information known about it, it is relatively easy to bioengineer into a cellular factory to produce many desirable proteins and chemicals. For example, E. coli were used in industrial fermentation processes to produce some of the first synthetic human insulin. Today we'll be exploring a model of E. Coli metabolism"

    "    - Note that the model loads with a default flux distribution. The default glucose uptake (EX_glc_e) in this model is -10 (negative flux here suggests uptake of glucose)  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Play around with the constraints on each reaction and observe how the different metabolic pathways interact. Take note of all the inputs and outputs to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Find out if there are any constraints on O2 uptake (EX_o2_e) in the model and determine the O2 influx in the default flux distribution\n",
    "    - Quick way to track down a reaction on Escher-FBA is to use \"Ctrl+F\" and then type in the ID of the reaction you are looking for. In this case EX_o2_e.\n",
    "    - Mouse over the reaction ID and note down the upper and lower bound. The default upper and lower bounds on the flux is 1000 and -1000 respectively. In most models this means there are no limits (or constraints) imposed on the flux.\n",
    "    - Mousing over the reaction ID can also reveal the current flux through the reaction.\n",
    "    - Note down the influxes and outfluxes of the model in aerobic conditions (all reactions starting with \"EX_\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What happens if the model does not have access to O2 in its environment? (as anaerobic scenario)\n",
    "    - Mouse over the EX_o2_e reaction and use the sliders or value-entry-box to set the lower bound of the reaction to 0\n",
    "    - Note the change in flux. \n",
    "    - Mouse over reactions to learn more about the reactions.\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Optimizing for biomass\n",
    "A) (20 mins) The model objective is to optimize for biomass. Have a look another look at the inputs and outputs and loosen the constraints on the other potential bacterial substrates to see which combination results in the fastest growing bacterial colony (results in the greatest biomass flux). Which pathways do these substrates feed into? Have a look at where they are contributing to the ATP/reducing power (NADH/NADPH) in the cell. Why are some more desirable than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "B) (30 mins) Aldehydes in general are toxic to microorganisms due to their high reactivity. They have been shown to inhibit growth of E. Coli colonies. Additionally, E. Coli grow optimally in isotonic media - that is a solution in which the dissolved substrates do not exert any more osmotic pressure than the contents of the cell. In hypertonic media, where the concentration of substrates is too high for E. Coli, they begin to dehydrate which slows down their growth. We will assume for the purposes of this exercise that no acetaldehyde (acald) is the optimal amount of acetaldehyde for E. Coli growth and also that an isotonic solution means that the combined inwards flux of all potential substrates can be no more than 10 µmol/s. What is the new optimal flux for the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "C) (40 mins) How would this change if we wanted our E. Coli colony to produce something else? What is the optimal medium to grow them in to produce ethanol? What if we wanted to maximise the ratio of ethanol to succinate?\n"
