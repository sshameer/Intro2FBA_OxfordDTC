    "FBA is the most popular approach in CBM. In FBA, in addition to the above requirements, an expression representing the biological objective of the system is defined. Unicellular organism typically aim to simply grow and multiply. When modelling these systems, a biomass composition is experimentally determined and the information is used to add a reaction that drains metabolites and macromolecules in the same proportion from the system. This reaction is called the \"Biomass\" reaction. Any flux through the biomass reaction represents the growth by cell division. Specialized tissue in multicellular organisms on the other hand may have completely different purpose. For example, the purpose of mesophyl cells that make up most of the leaves in plants is to generate sugar and amino acids for the plant using energy from the sun. The aim of cortical cells of mature roots on the other hand would be to uptake nutrients from the soil and load into the xylem to distributed to the rest of the plant. In these cases, an equation representing the specific objective need to be defined.\n",

In hypertonic media, where the concentration of substrates is too high for E. Coli, they begin to dehydrate which slows down their growth. We will assume for the purposes of this exercise that no acetaldehyde (acald) is the optimal amount of acetaldehyde for E.
